I would advise using the following open source license for a drone controller app, taking into account the nature of the project and any potential safety implications:

Version 3.0 of the GNU General Public License (GPL)


Rationale:

Copyleft: Since the GPL-3.0 license is a copyleft license, all modifications and derivative works based on your project must be distributed under the same terms. This guarantees that the drone controller app's essential features and security precautions continue to be open source and accessible to the public.

User Freedom: The GPL-3.0 license ensures user freedom by mandating that anyone who shares or modifies your software must likewise make the related source code available. Collaboration, openness, and community involvement are encouraged by this.
