## Code Style and Conventions

### 1. Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code, with the following additional guidelines:
   - Use meaningful variable and function names that accurately convey their purpose.
   - Limit line length to 80 characters to ensure readability.
   - Use consistent indentation with 4 spaces.
   - Separate functions and classes with two blank lines for improved clarity.
   - Utilize type hints to improve code readability and maintainability.
   - Comment your code effectively to explain complex logic, assumptions, or non-obvious behaviors.
   - Use descriptive docstrings to provide clear explanations of functions, classes, and modules.
   - Take advantage of linters, such as pylint or flake8, to automatically enforce code style and catch potential issues.
